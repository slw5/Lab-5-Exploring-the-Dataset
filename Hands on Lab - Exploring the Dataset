Lab: Exploring the Dataset
IntroductionÂ¶
Data exploration is the initial phase of data analysis where we aim to understand the data's characteristics, identify patterns, and uncover potential insights. It is a crucial step that helps us make informed decisions about subsequent analysis.

Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

Summarize the key characteristics of a dataset.
Identify different data types commonly used in data analysis.

Install the required library
import micropip

await micropip.install('pandas')

# Import pandas after installation
import pandas as pd
print(pd.__version__)

<ipython-input-1-4a848102c67d>:6: DeprecationWarning: 
Pyarrow will become a required dependency of pandas in the next major release of pandas (pandas 3.0),
(to allow more performant data types, such as the Arrow string type, and better interoperability with other libraries)
but was not found to be installed on your system.
If this would cause problems for you,
please provide us feedback at https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/54466
        
  import pandas as pd
2.2.0

Load the dataset
Read Data
We utilize the pandas.read_csv() function for reading CSV files. However, in this version of the lab, which operates on JupyterLite, the dataset needs to be downloaded to the interface using the provided code below.

The functions below will download the dataset into your browser:

from pyodide.http import pyfetch
import pandas as pd

async def download(url, filename):
    response = await pyfetch(url)
    if response.status == 200:
        with open(filename, "wb") as f:
            f.write(await response.bytes())

  import pandas as pd

file_path = "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/n01PQ9pSmiRX6520flujwQ/survey-data.csv"

To obtain the dataset, utilize the download() function as defined above:

await download(filename, 'survey-data.csv')

filename="survey-data.csv"

print("done") 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
Cell In[2], line 1
----> 1 await download(filename, 'survey-data.csv')
      3 filename="survey-data.csv"
      5 print("done") 

NameError: name 'download' is not defined


Utilize the Pandas method read_csv() to load the data into a dataframe.
df = pd.read_csv(dataset_url)
